## How the game works

You start the game using the button on the initial page.

![Home page](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/customrevolution/battleships-game/main/docs/images/game-home.png)


On game start you and the computer get 3 randomly placed ships on the grid:
* **Battleship** x 1 - *5* tiles
* **Destroyer** x 2 - *4* tiles

You and the computer fire until someone sinks all of the enemy's ships.
You sink a ship by firing on all of it's tiles.
When you hit a tile it gets marked with an 'X'. When you miss it gets marked with a dash.
